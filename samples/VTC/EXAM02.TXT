1.  The circuit below shows a 4Kx8 RAM chip with its decoding logic.
    Draw a memory map showing where the RAM chip's location and the
    locations of any copies of the chip that might exist (foldback
    memory).


2.  The program below exercises two I/O ports.

          ORG  1800h
    Loop:
          IN   A, (40h)
          OUT  (60h), A
          JP   Loop

    For each instruction, specify the machine cycles that the processor
    would execute. For each machine cycle specify what you would expect
    to see on the address and data lines. Be as specific as you can.


3.  Write a program fragment which does the following:

    A.    Initialize an 8255A so that port A and port C are outputs
          (mode 0) and port B is an input (mode 0).

    B.    Use the bit set/reset mode to turn on the MSB and LSB of
          port C.

    Use the equates below

    PORT_A     EQU       40h
    PORT_B     EQU       41h
    PORT_C     EQU       42h
    CNTRL_PORT EQU       43h



4.  Answer the following questions regarding interrupts.

     A) What is the minimum amount of stack space used by an interrupt
        service routine. Explain.









     B) Suppose you are working with a device that will need some
        kind of service within 100 uS after it requests service (or
        it will explode). Is it feasible for this device to be serviced
        by software (ie an ISR) or must it be handled totally with
        hardware? What if it needs service in 1 uS? Explain.















     C) In this class we've talked about enabling interrupts at the end
        of the ISR. This prevents the ISR from itself being interrupted.
        Is it necessarly an error to have an ISR get interrupted? If so,
        explain why. If not, explain when you might want it to happen.


5.  Suppose the following code is executed to initialize a Z-80 system.

     LD   DE, IVT
     LD   HL, 1A00h
     LD   B, 08h
Copy_Loop:
     LD   A, (DE)
     LD   (HL), A
     INC  HL
     INC  DE
     DJNZ Copy_Loop

     LD   A, 1Ah
     LD   I, A
     IM   2
     EI
     ; etc ...

IVT: DEFB 012h, 034h, 056h, 078h
     DEFB 09Ah, 0BCh, 0DEh, 0F0h




     Suppose also that the hardware shown above was connected to the
     Z-80's busses. When the DEV* signal goes low an interrupt is
     requested. What is the address of the interrupt service routine?
     FOR FULL CREDIT, DESCRIBE YOUR REASONING!
