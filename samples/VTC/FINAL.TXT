1. Suppose the registers contained the following:

     A = 10h
B = 20h  C = FFh
D = 0Fh  E = 40h
H = 53h  L = 9Ch

Show what the S, Z, and C flags will be after each of the instructions
in the following program executes.

Instruction         S         Z         C
CP   B

CP   C

CP   A

CP   D














2. Explain what is meant by the phrase "a pointer."


3. Assemble the following program. Use a starting address of 1900h

     LD   IX, 1D00
     LD   B, 10
Top:
     INC  (IX-2)
     INC  IX
     DEC  B
     JP   NZ, Top
     HALT





















4. What range of addresses activates the indicated output below.


5. Suppose the following circuit is connected to the data bus of a Z-80
   system. If the processor is run in interrupt mode 0, what is the
   address of the interrupt service routine?

























6. Explain the function of the I register.


7. Suppose an analog input signal is to be sampled at the rate of 40,000
   samples per second. How many "typical" Z-80 instructions could be
   executed between samples? Explain your reasoning. Do you think any
   significant processing could be done by a Z-80 on data coming at
   such a rate?

























8. Suppose you were working with a Z-80 CTC that was decoded so that
   channels zero through three appeared at port addresses 90h - 93h.
   Write a program fragment (ie show instructions) that will configure
   channel zero as a counter to count 100 external events. Have the CTC
   interrupt the Z-80 when done using interrupt vector number 70h. Make
   any don't care or unspecified bits in the control word zeros.

9. The program below writes to an eight bit D/A converter that has a
   9 volt full scale voltage. Sketch the waveform coming out of the
   converter. Show each step along with its voltage. You do not need
   to show times.

     DEFB 010h, 020h, 030h, 040h, 080h, 090h, 0A0h, 0B0h




















10. What control word do you need to send to an 8255A to configure it
    so that ports A and C are simple inputs and port B is a simple
    output?
