EL-214 Worksheet on Timing
==========================

Assume that you have a Z-80A running at 4 MHz (full speed).

How long must WAIT* be low during the memory read machine cycle to
guarantee that it will be sensed correctly?

With one wait state in the memory read machine cycle, how long after a
valid address becomes available does memory have to produce valid data?

What is the narrowest clock pulse allowed?

What is the slowest rise time of the clock signal?

How long is M1* low during the op-code fetch?

During a memory read, is it possible for MREQ* to be valid before the
address is valid?

During a memory write, how long will the processor drive the data bus after
WR* is released?
