1.  What control word and time constant would you have to send to a
    CTC channel to program it as a counter that could count 50 rising
    edges of the CLK input? Don't worry about interrupts.


2.  Write the subroutine Initialize CTC below. The subroutine is to
    program channel 2 of the CTC as a timer using a time constant of
    37h. Use a prescale factor of /256 and auto triggering. Enable
    interrupts and initialize the Z-80 interrupt system so that

          The interrupt vector table is located in the range
          1D00 - 1DFF.

          The CTC is using interrupt vectors 60h, 62h, 64h, and 66h.

          The channel 2 interrupt service routine is at 19A8h.

    CTC_0   EQU  40h     ; Use these equates in your program.
    CTC_1   EQU  41h
    CTC_2   EQU  42h
    CTC_3   EQU  43h

    Initialize_CTC:



3.  Assume you are using a Z-80 system with a 4MHz clock. Assume also
    that you wanted to generate an interrupt every second. What time
    constant(s) would you need to send to a CTC to do this? Would you
    program the CTC in counter mode or timer mode?


4.  Consider the simple D/A circuit shown below. What is the step size
    and full scale voltage?


5.  Suppose you were working with an eight bit D/A converter that had
    a FULL SCALE output voltage of 12.000 volts. Assume also that the
    Z-80 you're working with had a clock frequency of 6MHz. Consider the
    program below.

     LD   A, 00
Loop:
     OUT  (DAC), A
     SUB  10h
     JP   Loop

     What is the shape of the output waveform? Show a sketch that includes
     correct voltages and times. You don't need to worry about showing
     all the steps.
