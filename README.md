Z80sim
======

This project contains a Z80 simulator intended to be of educational interest. The program was
originally conceived to help students in computer engineering technology at Vermont Technical
College. However, that was many years ago when we were using Z80s in our microprocessor classes.
Yet the program is still interesting in many respects and might be a useful template for other
processor simulators.
